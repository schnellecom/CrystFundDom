# The GAP package CrystFundDom
This package is intended to allow the computation of fundamental domains via Dirichlet cells for given crystallographic group and starting point.
It uses `polymaking` and provides a format which is easy to use in the packages `SimplicialSurfaces` and `GAPic`, for an example see the manual.

## Status
Currently this package is working, as described in the manual. However the following are features planned for the future:
- [ ] Provide checks for computed fundamental domain
- [ ] Add library of "nice" fundamental domains
- [ ] Add automatic version, that increases the word length until the desired volume is met
